/*
üîÑ Recomposable in Jetpack Compose:
A recomposable is a Composable function or part of the UI that is re-executed (recomposed) automatically by the Compose runtime when the state(data) it depends on changes, in order to update the UI.

‚öôÔ∏è When does recomposition happen?
When a State, MutableState, or LiveData/Flow (via collectAsState) changes

When remember or derivedStateOf values are updated

When you explicitly call invalidate() in custom state management

üß† Why is recomposition important?
Because Jetpack Compose uses declarative UI, you describe the UI, and Compose updates only what changes, efficiently, through recomposition.
